## E-Commerce App

In this fullstack project, I write on how to build and deploy an impressive, e-commerce app made with Next 13, Sanity and Stripe from start to finish. This project has every major feature you would expect from a modern e-commerce app, such as an attractive and accessible user interface, a powerful shopping cart, where customers can add, update and remove items from their cart, the ability to sort products by different criteria, such as price and date, an advanced filter component, that enables users to select products according to properties such as category, size, and color, as well as a full-text search to find any product with ease.

Customers will be able to choose products from a range of sizes and view different product images through a custom image gallery that youâ€™ll create for each item. And when customers are ready to check out, they can review and manage items in their cart, see and change the running total with shipping costs, and then purchase their items through our own custom Stripe checkout page.

And to top it off, our app will have a fully responsive design for any size device.
